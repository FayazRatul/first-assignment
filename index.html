        <h2>Our Donate Plan</h2>
        <p>It's easier to take than to give. It's nobler to give than to take. The thrill of taking lasts a day. The
            thrill of giving lasts a lifetime.</p>

                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p>Firstly we will manage food for everyone. We will arrange some packet. Each packet contains food
                    items including rice, pulses, oil, salt and sugar, which is expected to last a week for a family of
                    five </p>

                <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                <p>Education helps people become better citizens, get a better-paid job, shows the difference
                    between good and bad. So we will try to provide free education for poor children.</p>

            <p>Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little. Alone we can do
                so little, together we can do so much. At this time they need food, shelter, medicine, etc. They are
                satrving by many days. Their home, field everything are under the water. They have nothing. At this
                moment, they need donation.</p>

            <h2>They need us to survive</h2>
            <p>When you donate money,you will be used to rapidly procure resources, providing a constant stream of
                relief services and goods. This is the fastest form of relief that an ordinary person can undertake, as
                disaster relief is incredibly expensive. There are many long-term costs of rebuilding the damaged
                communities, and NGOs like Save the Children need all the assistance they can get keeping children safe
                from disease, the preying eyes of child exploitation, and illiteracy. You can easily donate online via
                net banking, thereby helping thousands of motivated volunteers, officers and employees working in an
                NGO.</p>
